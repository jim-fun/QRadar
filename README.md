IBM QRadar Scripts from an enthusiast<br>

IBM QRadar reference lists can be leveraged in rules to match IOCs. These pyton scripts are two examples of loading files into references lists and can be schedule or run manually.<br> 

<code>csi.py reads files created by another script and adds the entries to the reference list.</code>
<code>seculert_crime_servers.py pulls from an API and pushes the result to a reference list.</code>
